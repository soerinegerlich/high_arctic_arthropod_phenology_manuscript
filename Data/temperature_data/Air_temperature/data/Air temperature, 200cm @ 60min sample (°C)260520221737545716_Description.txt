ClimateBasis Zackenberg - Air temperature - Air temperature, 200cm @ 60min sample (°C)
Air temperature measured on two proximal climate stations at 200 cm above ground as a 60min sample (°C). The double masted climate station is located north of the station at 44 m a.s.l.. The timeseries starts in 1995. Quality control is performed on both datasets from the double mast system. The combined time series is calculated as an average of the 2 sensors, or if data is missing from 1 sensor the other used in conjunction with a regression. Please read the metadata file provided with the data for comments related to the data in this timeseries.
